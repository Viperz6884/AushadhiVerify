## 1. Overview

AushadhiVerify ensures medicine authenticity by recording every lifecycle event on a permissioned blockchain and validating packaging through AI-based analysis. It enables patients, pharmacists, manufacturers, and regulators to verify products in real-time using secure QR scans and automated intelligence.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Counterfeit and substandard medicines pose a critical global threat due to:

- Inability to visually distinguish fake products  
- Vulnerable paper-based supply records  
- Complex and fragmented distribution channels  
- Delayed regulatory intervention  

AushadhiVerify addresses these challenges with a secure, transparent, and verifiable digital framework.

---

## 3. Core Solution

AushadhiVerify delivers multi-layered protection through:

- **Blockchain-based provenance** for tamper-proof tracking  
- **Digital birth certificates** for every medicine unit  
- **Immutable chain-of-custody** across stakeholders  
- **AI-powered packaging verification**  
- **Anomaly detection for distribution patterns**  
- **Smart-contract finalization** at dispensing  

This creates a trusted, auditable, and real-time verification ecosystem.

## 4. Key Features

- Unique QR identity generated at manufacturing  
- Permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)  
- Digitally signed handovers at every transfer  
- Computer-vision detection of sophisticated counterfeits  
- Machine-learning-based anomaly monitoring  
- Mobile app for consumers and pharmacists  
- Web dashboard for regulators and manufacturers  
- Smart-contract status lock to prevent serial reuse

## 5. System Architecture

**Core Components**

- **Permissioned Blockchain Network**  
  Stores immutable lifecycle and ownership records

- **Backend API Services (Node.js)**  
  Facilitates secure communication between all modules

- **AI/ML Services**  
  - Packaging authenticity verification  
  - Supply-chain anomaly detection

- **Front-End Applications**  
  - Mobile App (Flutter/React Native)  
  - Web Dashboard (React/Vue)

**Data Flow (High-Level)**

1. User scans medicine via mobile app  
2. Backend queries blockchain for history  
3. Packaging image analyzed by AI model  
4. Results consolidated and returned  
5. Product marked as genuine or flagged
